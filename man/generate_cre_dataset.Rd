\description{
Generates synthetic data sets to run simulation for causal inference
experiments composed by an outcome vector (\code{y}), a treatment vector (\code{z}),
a covariates matrix (\code{X}), and an unobserved individual treatment effects
vector (\code{ite}).
The arguments specify the data set characteristic, including the
number of individuals (\code{n}), the number of covariates (\code{p}), the correlation
within the covariates (\code{rho}),  the number of decision rules
(\code{n_rules}) decomposing the Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE), the
treatment effect magnitude (\code{effect_size}), the confounding mechanism
(\code{confounding}), whether the outcome is binary or continuous (\code{binary_outcome}),
and whether the covariates are binary, continuous, or categorical
(\code{class_covariates}).
}
\details{
The covariates matrix is generated with the specified correlation among
individuals, and each covariate is sampled either from a
\code{Bernoulli(0.5)} if binary, a \code{Gaussian(0,1)} if continuous, or a
\code{categorical("A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F")} if categorical.
For binary and continuous covariates, the treatment vector is sampled from a
\code{Bernoulli}(\eqn{\frac{1}{1+ \exp(1-x_1+x_2-x_3)}}), enforcing the treatment
assignment probabilities to be a function of observed covariates. For categorical
covariates, the treatment vector is determined by assigning numerical values to
\eqn{x_1, x_2, x_3}.
The potential outcomes (\eqn{y(0)} and \eqn{y(1)}) are then sampled from a Bernoulli
if binary, a Gaussian (with standard deviation equal to 1) if continuous.
Their mean is equal to a confounding term (null, linear or non-linear and
always null for binary outcome) plus 1-4 decision rules weighted by the
treatment effect magnitude. The two potential outcomes characterizes the CATE
(and then the unobserved individual treatment effects vector) as the sum of
different additive contributions for each decision rules considered
(plus an intercept).
The final expression of the CATE depends on the treatment effect magnitude
and the number of decision rules considered.

The 4 decision rules are:
\itemize{
\item Rule 1: \eqn{1\{x_1 > 0.5; x_2 \leq 0.5\}(\textbf{x})}
\item Rule 2: \eqn{1\{x_5 > 0.5; x_6 \leq 0.5\}(\textbf{x})}
\item Rule 3: \eqn{1\{x_4 \leq 0.5\}(\textbf{x})}
\item Rule 4: \eqn{1\{x_5 \leq 0.5; x_7 > 0.5; x_8 \leq 0.5\}(\textbf{x})}
with corresponding additive average treatment effect (AATE) equal to:
\item Rule 1: \eqn{-} \code{effect_size},
\item Rule 2: \eqn{+} \code{effect_size},
\item Rule 3: \eqn{- 0.5 \cdot} \code{effect_size},
\item Rule 4: \eqn{+ 2 \cdot} \code{effect_size}.
}

In example, setting \code{effect_size}=4 and \code{n_rules}=2:
\deqn{\text{CATE}(\textbf{x}) = -4 \cdot 1\{x_1 > 0.5; x_2 \leq 0.5\}(\textbf{x}) +
4 \cdot 1\{x_5 > 0.5; x_6 \leq 0.5\}(\textbf{x})}

The final outcome vector \code{y} is finally computed by combining the potential
outcomes according to the treatment assignment.

\note{
Set the covariates domain (\code{class_covariates}) and outcome domain
(\code{binary_outcome}) according to the experiment of interest.
Increase complexity in heterogeneity discovery:
\itemize{
\item decreasing the sample size (\code{n}),
\item adding correlation among covariates (\code{rho}),
\item increasing the number of rules (\code{n_rules}),
\item increasing the number of covariates (\code{p}),
\item decreasing the absolute value of the causal effect (\code{effect_size}),
\item adding linear or not-linear confounders (\code{confounding}).
